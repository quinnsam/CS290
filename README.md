#CS290 Web Development
##Spring 2016
###Assignment 1 HTML/CSS
This week you will be making a simple web page. You will submit a .zip file to Canvas which contains exactly two files, content.html and style.css. content.html will have all of the html content and will link to the style.css style-sheet.

###Assignment 2 Higher-Order Functions and Objects
This assignment is graded based on correctness and will require you to use higher-order functions to sort automobiles. You should submit a single .js file called automobile.js which when run with node.js using the command "node automobile.js" produces the described results. You must make use of  higher-order functions to sort the cars. You should not, for example, create entirely separate functions each with dedicated loops to sort the cars. You will need a loop (or potentially more than one loop depending on your sorting algorithm of choice) in the sortArr function but that is pretty much it.
